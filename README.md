To render the tutorial on your own computer, you need to have Quarto installed.

[quarto]: (https://quarto.org/)

Further, the R package [`renv`][renv] is used to track the project's dependencies

[renv]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=renv

One can install `renv` by running the following:

```r
install.packages("renv")
```

Then, one can restore the dependencies tracked with `renv` by running the following:

```r
renv::restore()
```

While you are working on the tutorial, you can preview it by running:

```sh
quarto preview
```

This will open the tutorial in your browser.
If you make any changes, the website will automatically reload.

If you are done editing and would like to render the tutorial to a static website,
run the following:

```sh
quarto render
```
